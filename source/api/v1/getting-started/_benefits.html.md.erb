## Why To Use Tazapay Escrow Service

### Understanding funds flow

Collect payments from buyers, hold it until the seller/service provider fulfills their obligations before releasing the  payment to them. It offers protection to both buyers and sellers by giving equal control over created payments for awarded contracts/projects.

Control how funds flow :

- Buyer and seller will confirm the order/contract/PO on your platform.
- Your platform originates the escrow transaction with Tazapay.
- Buyer makes a payment, Tazapay notifies your platform of “money receipt”.
- Your platform updates the “payment status” on your dashboard.
- Your platform sends a payment release instruction once the seller completes the agreed milestone.
- Tazapay transfers funds to the seller after deducting your platform fee.
- Settlement between Tazapay and the platform is going to be gross-settlement in phases. Tazapay will transfer your fees after deducting Tazapay fees on a bi-weekly basis.

Net settlement will be built in due course.

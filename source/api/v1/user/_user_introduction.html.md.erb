# Create and connect your customer accounts

## Create and Connect Your Seller/Supplier’s Account

A supplier’s account will be a completely native account to the marketplace and the seller/ supplier will not have to access the Tazapay account. You can create Tazapay accounts for your sellers/suppliers using the“Users API” anytime after they onboard on to your platform.

The account that you create via the user’s API will be linked to your platform account and you will have authorization to transact on behalf of the merchant using Tazapay’s APIs. You can create a new connected account by submitting 4 key pieces of information: 

- Primary contact email address
- Country
- Account type = Business (or) Individual. 
- If Business, provide business name; if Individual, provide the first name and last name of the individual.

By creating the account via the "Users API", you implicitly indicate the user's acceptance of Tazapay’s terms & conditions. Also, you consent to the terms covering the tri-party relationship between Tazapay, your business and the party on whose behalf you are opening the account, and in doing so Tazapay is authorised to take action on the connected account according to your instructions.

## Create and Connect Your Buyer/Client’s Account

A buyer/client account is a non-native account and the buyer/client will have to set a password while accessing Tazapay for the first time. You can create a Tazapay account for your buyer/client when they sign up on your platform or when they are about to initiate an escrow payment.

To create and connect your buyer/client’s account, you need to follow the steps given below:

Step 1: You can create a new connected account by submitting 4 key pieces of information: 

* Primary contact email address
* Country
* Account type = Business (or) Individual. 
* If Business, provide business name; if Individual, provide the first name and last name of the individual.

Step 2: The buyer/client will have to set a password with Tazapay while using the account for the first time to make a payment.

By creating the account via the "Users API", you implicitly indicate the user's acceptance of Tazapay’s terms & conditions. Also, you consent to the terms covering the tri-party relationship between Tazapay, your business and the party on whose behalf you are opening the account, and in doing so Tazapay is authorised to take action on the connected account according to your instructions.

## Transact On Behalf Of Your Customers

Using the Tazapay Account-id of the account connected to your platform, you will be able to transact on behalf of the customer in-line with the authorisation-level provided using the tazapay regular endpoints.

For example, you will be able to:

- Create an escrow transaction based on the contract/PO created on your platform
- Originate a new payment request on behalf of your buyer. For buyers/clients, since their money is being held by Tazapay, for compliance & legal reasons they will have to create a Tazapay account and originate payment through a Tazapay hosted payment page.
- Verify your seller’s business
- Get escrow status
- Originate payouts to your seller’s bank account

To call the end-point on behalf of the customer, simply specify the account-ID when making a request.
